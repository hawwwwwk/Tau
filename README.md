Tau is a multi-use general-purpose discord bot written in beautiful C# utilizing the DSharpPlus library.

NOTE: This repository has been archived. I don't why on god's green earth I thought trying to write a discord bot in C# was a good idea, but now I know that. Anyways, I'm going to make things that are like, efficient now lmao. The bot should still work if you build a dll from the source code, but why would you?
